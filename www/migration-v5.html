<h2>Migration From v4 (and below) to v5</h2>

<p>
   Version 5 brings WebGL Renderer to the game. It is a default renderer from now on, and there might be possible
    considerations:

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
    <li>
        it might cause issues with (older) devices
    </li>
    <li>
        problems with tained data, make sure you download images from the same domain, or set <code>crossOriginPolicy: 'Anonymous'</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        tile data is not directly modifiable since it now lives on the GPU, therefore <code>tile-drawing</code>-based
        functions do not work
    </li>
    <li>
        in general, any data modification might be problematic, so plugins like OpenSeadragon Filtering will
        not likely work
    </li>
    </ul>

    If you experience issues, you might consider sticking with the Context2D canvas drawer. We will
    be also grateful for any feedbacks on issues with devices.

<pre>
const viewer = OpenSeadragon({
    ....
    drawer: 'canvas'
});
