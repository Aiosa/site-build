<h2>
    example: zoomify tile support
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.zoomify.com/">Zoomify</a> was a popular viewer to display large images in the past with Flash (and now without it, of course). It is still used in various places, because it is not only a viewer, but a tile builder too and it has some enterprise features. Its popularity was related to the fact that an extension was added to a popular commercial image application. An old description of the format can be found <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/5410/Introducing_Zoomify_Image.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The tile sources can be produced by the commercial tool Zoomify, but scripts were written for common web languages (see <a href="/examples/creating-zooming-images/">creating zooming images</a>). Other common viewers support this format, for example <a href="https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/zoomify.html">OpenLayers</a>.

    OpenSeadragon supports Zoomify tiles thanks to <a href="https://github.com/foobarable">foobarable</a>.

    <h3>Inline Configuration for Zoomify</h3>
    <p>
        Currently, only inline configuration is supported, because Zoomify metadata are not in a standard xml file.

        Supply all necessary information in the <code>tilesource</code> object. A minimal example object for this method looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
OpenSeadragon({
    ...
    tileSources: [{
        //required	
        type:       "zoomifytileservice",
        width:      7026,
        height:     9221,
        tilesUrl:   "/test/data/zoomify/",
        //optional
        tileSize: 256,
        fileFormat: 'jpg'	
    }]
    ...
});</pre>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    OpenSeadragon({
        id:             "example-inline-configuration-for-zoomify",
        prefixUrl:      "/openseadragon/images/",
        showNavigator:  true,
        tileSources:    [{
            type:       "zoomifytileservice",
            width:      7026,

            tilesUrl:   "/example-images/highsmith/highsmith_zdata/"
        }]
    });
